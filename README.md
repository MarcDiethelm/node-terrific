# Node Terrific

This project brings the Terrific.js pattern to Node and Express. It provides a solid template for most web projects.
It implements some of the features of Terrific Composer, like server-side module includes.

## Features
- Light-weight and hackable JavaScript backend
- Can be used for single page apps.
- Server-side module includes.
- Handlebars templates.
- Modularization
- Flexible asset pipeline using Grunt.js // tbd: with sections for inlined, linked and on-demand assets.
- Automated testing

At risk:
- Grunt.js templates for efficient and consistent project and module creation.
- NPM packaging this project as a tool for super-easy project creation

## DOCS
naming convention:

- use - (hyphen for pretty much everything: module names, skins, template files)
- 'lib' is for any third-party code that we don't touch: libraries, jquery plugins

### Templates and views
In node-terrific the distinction between templates and views are as follows:

- Templates (`/templates`): Your basic document(s), typically a HTML document that contains all the things that are
always needed: HEAD, scripts, tracking and so on. Your template base template can be set in each route controller using
the layout property or disabled altogether with `layout: false`. A template that has a `{{{body}}}` variable will
include a
- View (`/frontend/views`): A view typically corresponds to an individual page with an URL. This is where you include
any modules specific to the page.

### Terrific Folder: Order matters
A simple but important concept is to understand how the default folders in /terrific are included. Any files you throw
in there are included and executed like so:

- `_inline` folder: Any style or JS sources in here are available in the files `inline.js` (todo: and `inline.css`).
This is a good place for basic bootstrapping code and dependencies like an asset loader or possibly some initial data
for use in a model. Use widely and sparingly.
- `base` folder: anything that needs to be defined before including any modules: LessCSS variables, mixins, grids,
some global JS code like Modernizr or other utilities and libraries and plugins.
- `mod-something` folders: All your module code and styles absically everything visible that's not pure layout.
- `_application` folder: The code that actually starts your app: Terrific bootstrap and any other global logic that
depends on modules being available. If you need to build themeing into your app, this is the place too.

## todo

- docs: node setup & new project setup
- docs: building with grunt
- docs: config and dev/prod modes, templating: assets variable vs. env block helper
- use config.js for grunt paths
- include prototyping/wireframe styles and a basic template using it. (similar to http://cs-cdw-proto.namics.com/)
- test automation
- module creation (wizard?)
- folder naming
- (npm publish: module-terrific.js?)
- auth info to config.js
- grunt: linting?
- inline css?
- documentation templates/placeholders (READMEs, plugins, libs, modules, etc.)

- grunt: minification DONE
- @import DONE
- bootstrap DONE
- file watcher DONE
- module include DONE
- js skins DONE

## What this does not
- shared logic to create correct state
- Dependency management
- Code and template re-use between browser and server.
- No client-side rendering is built in, so info below is out of context:
	- Initial rendering is done at the server, subsequent changes are rendered directly in the browser.
	- 'Ajax crawling' support: non-JS clients can get a semantically sensible representation of any page URI.
	- Handlebars templates precompilation
- Easy appcache manifest generation through Grunt
- database access from server and browser
